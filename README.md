# Roadmap Frontend https://roadmapabv.netlify.app/

This is a roadmap frontend built using React, Redux, and Tailwind CSS. It is designed to showcase the core concepts of React and Redux, as well as provide a platform for developers to practice and improve their skills.

## Features

- Core React Concepts: This section covers the fundamental building blocks of React, including components, props, state, effects, conditional rendering, list rendering, forms, and event handling.
- Hooks Mastery: This section focuses on the powerful hooks in React, including useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useRef, useMemo, useCallback, and custom hooks.
- Common UI Components: This section explores various UI components commonly used in React applications, such as Todo List, Search/Filter, Accordion, Modal, Tabs, Pagination, Infinite Scroll, Form with Validation, Autocomplete/Typeahead, Rating, and Image Carousel/Slider.
- Data Fetching & APIs: This section covers the process of fetching data from APIs using the Fetch API or Axios, including loading and error states, debouncing API calls, caching strategies, polling and real-time updates, handling async operations, error boundaries, and retry logic.
- State Management: This section delves into the various state management techniques in React, including local component state, lifting state up, context API implementation, useReducer patterns, Redux basics, state synchronization, and derived state.
- Performance Optimization: This section covers the optimization techniques for React applications, including React.memo for component memoization, useMemo for computed values, useCallback for stable references, code splitting and lazy loading, virtualization for long lists, debouncing and throttling, and avoiding unnecessary re-renders.
- Routing & Navigation: This section explores the routing and navigation capabilities of React, including React Router setup, route parameters, nested routes, protected routes, programmatic navigation, and query parameters handling.
- Testing Essentials: This section covers the essential testing techniques for React applications, including writing unit tests, testing user interactions, mocking API calls, testing hooks, and snapshot testing.
